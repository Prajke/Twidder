# Twidder - Social media website 
Twidder is a social media website were users can create a profile to post notes and view profile pages. This was a full-stack web development project, where a single-page application was created using Python Flask & JavaScript as back-end and Html & Css as front-end. Requests are sent with JavaScript to a Flask server that retrieves from and stores information in a local SQLite database. 

# What I have learned
